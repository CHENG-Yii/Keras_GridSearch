# Keras_GridSearch
This is a project where I am creating a grid search cross validation 
with Keras and scikit-learn for deep learning. My aim is to automate 
the hyperparameter tuning and maximise the accuracy with a script that 
could be applicable to multiple datasets with only little adjustment.

I used the pre-processing ideas from Udacity and got also inspired by 
this post:

I am very happy to take constructive criticism, advice, and of course ... praise. :)
